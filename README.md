Concept map of a Condensed Matter course, in Italian

Should this evolev in a sort of course wiki?

Should be written in rst. A copy of the plan from Pmwiki/dispense below

This course is part of the Parma condensed matter master suite of courses, with two specialisations and two subtopics each:  ''crystalline'' (I. magnets and superconductors, II. semiconductors) and ''soft'' matter (I. biophysics, II. other soft structures). The course provides the foundations for the crystalline condensed matter syllabus and is recommended also for the ''soft'' specialisation. Since there is a separate ''Semiconductor Physics and Applications'' course, these special topics are avoided in the present course. Magnetism is also partially covered by ''Statistical Physics'' and ''Magnetism and Quantum Computation''. Therefore the present course contains four general chapters (Crystal Symmetries, Band Theory, Order and Excitations and Hands-on DFT), but focuses on two 
topics (Metals and Metal-Insulator transitions, Superfluids and Superconductors).

The approach includes general surveys of phenomena and properties, the main models and conceptual ideas, simple-case exercises, hands-on with software and web applications, illustration of main experimental techniques to measure the properties.

This course and the wiki are a work in progress. A very first draft is described [[CondensedMatter.CondensedMatter|here]]
This is a [[CondensedMatter.Template|page template]] for internal use.
