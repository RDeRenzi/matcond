Concept map of a Condensed Matter course, in Italian
Written in rst. A copy of the tentative plan from Pmwiki/dispense below

The course is offered in Parma University, at Graduate level. It provides the foundations for the hard condensed matter syllabus and is recommended also for the soft matter syllabus. It does not cover topics dealt with in  *Semiconductor Physics and Applications*, *Statistical Physics* and *Magnetism and Quantum Computation*. Therefore the present course contains four general chapters (Crystal Symmetries, Band Theory, Order and Excitations and Hands-on DFT), but focuses on two 
topics (Metals and Metal-Insulator transitions, Superfluids and Superconductors).

This course is work in progress. 

**Main textbooks**
* U. RÃ¶ssler  Solid State Theory, An Introduction. Springer Verlag (with physical intuition, good overview; with problems and solutions)
* J.F. Annett  Superconductivity, Superfluids and Condensates. Oxford Master Series (with physical intuition, specific for VI; with exercises and solutions)
* G. Grosso G Parravicini Solid State Physics. Academic Press (more formal, oriented towards semiconductors, good for II. and V.;  with a few solved exercises)
* D. Khomskii Basic Aspects of the Quantum Theory of Solids, Order and Elementary Excitations. Cambridge Press  (mixes physical intuition and a consistent theoretical approach, oriented towards strongly correlated materials, good for IV.)
